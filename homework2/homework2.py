# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
#    Absolute: full path from the filesystem root
#    Relative: path from my current directory

# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
#    Absolute:  ~/python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/homework2
#    Relative:  ../course_assignments/homework2

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
#    cd ..

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
#     It tries to remove the current directory entry 

# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add - stage changes for the next commit
# git commit - reate a snapshot in your local repo
# git push - send your local commits to the remote

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
#     "git add ." stages all changes in the current folder
#     "git add <file>" stages only the specified file(s)

# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
#     git status - show current branch, staged/unstaged/untracked files
#     git log -1 - show the most recent commit

# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
#     Clone = to copy a remote repo to a new local folder
#     Pull  = fetch + merge new commits into an existing local repo

# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
#     My most frustrating bug so far would be seeing "zsh: parse error near '\n'" in the terminal, because this happened 
#     to me while cloneing the file, and I realized by removing " < > " will simply solve the problem

# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
#     Something I am still confused about is what's the best language runned here at VSCode?

# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
#     I learned about C++ and Java, and also a little bit of javascript but I forgot everything! :)

# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
print("3 ** 2")
print( 3 ** 2 )
#     So far I really like the exponential sign, ** because it is different from other languages and it is new to me.
